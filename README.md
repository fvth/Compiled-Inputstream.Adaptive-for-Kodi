# Compiled "Inputstream.Adaptive" for Kodi

## About 
The inputstream.adaptive 64bit (aarch64 / arm64) version for Kodi Nexus. Usable for at least a Raspberry Pi 4 and Odroid C2.

Based on: https://github.com/xbmc/inputstream.adaptive/releases

Build via instructions: https://github.com/xbmc/inputstream.adaptive/wiki/How-to-build

## Other
You need this for Retrospect on Kodi 64bit. As it is not available currently in Libreelec 64bit. On a sideone, install Widevine for Retrospect via the Video player options. The installation via Retrospect itself tends to fail.
